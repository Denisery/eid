# WhatsApp Auto-Reply Bot

This is a WhatsApp bot built using [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) that automatically replies with **"Eid Mubarak Bhai! ðŸŒ™âœ¨"** when someone sends a message containing **"Eid"** or **"Mubarak"**. The bot also runs a web server to show its uptime and status.
